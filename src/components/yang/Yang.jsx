                Dr. Yang immigrated to Canada in 1990. Over the next 32 years, he dedicated himself to education and research at the University of Calgary, focusing on modernizing and digitizing classical Japanese literature, Emakimono, and medieval military literature. His work left a lasting impact, including the establishment of a cultural immersion program with Japanese universities in 2005. In recognition of his contributions to Japanese language studies and international understanding, he received the prestigious Order of the Rising Sun Award from the Government of Japan in 2016. Dr. Yangâ€™s students, colleagues, and loved ones will always remember him for his optimism and passion for teaching. His legacy will continue to inspire generations.
